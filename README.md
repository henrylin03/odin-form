# odin-form

Part of The Odin Project's ["Form Validation with JavaScript" lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-form-validation-with-javascript) of its "Full Stack JavaScript" course, this is a practice task of building:

* a webform...
* that collects various user information...
* which uses live, inline validation...
* using, primarily, the Constraint Validation API ([MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation))

I've built another web form in my [signup-form](https://github.com/henrylin03/signup-form) project ([live link](http://henrylin.io/signup-form/)) if you're interested, but that was more to practice form validation using _custom_ JavaScript, rather than the Constraint Validation API (although I did use it too)
